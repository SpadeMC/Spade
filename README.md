# Spade

Ever wanted to do something crazy with command blocks but the notation seemed too horrendous?
Ever wanted to make an adventure map which reacts to events?
Ever wanted to write code which uses both Minecraft commands and a server plugin?

If so, Spade may help.
Spade is an approachable programming language which can compile down to both mcfunctions, and Java!
It makes it much easier to take total and unquestionable command of all parts of your Minecraft world.

## Features

- A simple, unified syntax with similarities to other common languages
- Syntactic sugaring to allow useful tasks to be used by the programmer with minimal effort
- A strict type-system to catch errors before runtime and _without_ affecting efficiency (better than Java)
- A single language which can be run both on the server and client sides
- The compiler can run on any common operating system (Windows, MacOS and Linux)

## Installation

### Simple Download

You'll need:

- A PC running Windows, MacOS or Linux
- Some space

### Built from Scratch

If you'd like to build directly from the source code, you will need a number of smaller tools.
The following should suffice:

- `git` distributed version-control system
- `stack` build tool for Haskell
- `make` GNU generic build system
- `alex` Haskell lexical analyser generator
- `happy` Haskell parser generator
- `m4` GNU macro language
